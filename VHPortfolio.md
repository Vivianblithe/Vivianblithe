### Documentation for hybrid deployments of Genesys Predictive Routing

In a hybrid deployment model, some functionality is accessed through the Genesys Multicloud CX cloud (formerly Genesys PureEngage Cloud) and the remaining components are deployed in the customer environment).

**Note:** The documents linked here are all my own work as the sole writer for a new product.

I have uploaded copies of the following documentation:

* [Genesys Predictive Routing Deployment and Operations Guide](https://all.docs.genesys.com/PE-GPR/9.0.0/Deployment)
* [Genesys Predictive Routing Staff Help](https://github.com/Vivianblithe/Vivianblithe) (accessible from my personal GitHub repository)
* [Genesys Predictive Routing Help](https://all.docs.genesys.com/PE-GPR/9.0.0/Help) (for customers)
* [Genesys Predictive Routing Overview video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/312195823?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0) (I did the script and the static graphics; the graphics team did the animations and voiceover)

### Genesys predictive routing articles in the Genesys Cloud CX Resource Center

This documentation set is for the version of predictive routing released for Genesys Cloud. The UI and functionality differs considerably from the Multicloud/hybrid version documented in the manuals above.

**Note:** The documents linked here are all my own work as the sole writer for a new product.

### Blueprints documentation

Blueprints are technical articles explaining how to solve a specific use case, usually integrating Genesys functionality with third-party applications. These are created by SMEs, usually developers. A technical writer then performs a substantiative technical edit, that includes testing for missing or unclear procedures, revises it for documentation standards, clarity, and grammar, and reworks the diagram to comply with Genesys graphics standards. The following blueprints are ones I for which have been the technical writer:

* [Automate callbacks using always-running campaigns and data actions](https://developer.genesys.cloud/blueprints/automated-callback-blueprint/)
* [Deploy the Lex-Kendra chatbot on Genesys Cloud](https://developer.genesys.cloud/blueprints/aws-lex-kendra/)
* [Access an on-premises database from an AWS Lambda](https://developer.genesys.cloud/blueprints/lambda-premise-blueprint/)
