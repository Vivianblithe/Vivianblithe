## Profile
I create content that that smooths the way for users. I distill technical complexities into clear, accessible documentation, presented in whatever modality suits your needs, whether that is text, graphics, diagrams, videos, or API references and developer guides.

## Experience
**Senior Technical Writer, Genesys Cloud Services, Inc.  (2005 - present)**
**Technical Writer, Genesys Cloud Services, Inc. (2000 - 2005)**

Created deployment guides, user manuals, help files, integration guides, and videos for a wide range of software types including:
* Traditional servers, UIs, and databases deployed in a customer environment
* Cloud-based services on running on AWS and Azure or deployed in Docker containers and managed using Kubernetes
* Products deployed in a hybrid model, with both on-premises and cloud components.

#### Working methodologies
* Comfortable with Agile workflows
* Familiar with the use of content management services. 
* Experienced in using GitHub, Jenkins pipelines, and a docs-as-code approach to publishing documentation 
* Experienced in documenting on a wiki-based documentation platform

## Achievements
**Superior Writing Delivered Right** - Created the highly-regarded documentation set for a new high-profile product, consisting of two Help files for hybrid deployments (one for customers, one for internal users), a Deployment and Operations Guide for hybrid deployments, and a separate set of user documentation on a different documentation platform for a cloud-only version of the product with its own user interface, workflow, and functionality. 

**Project Management** - Frequently functioned as sole writer on assigned projects. Set and adjusted schedules for documentation deliverables in coordination with cross-functional team deadlines and requirements.

**Information Architecture** - Planned and executed development of the documentation sets required for a new high-profile project delivered on three documentation platforms for three deployment modalities having different use cases, deployment requirements, and user interfaces.

**Mentoring** - Mentored junior writers to improve their writing skills and, crucially, to reinforce the need for a customer-centric focus in all writing projects.

**Solving Issues Before they Happen** - Liaised effectively with Professional Services and Customer Care to improve documentation quality, resulting in fewer customer contacts and less time required for troubleshooting. 

**Technical Editing** - Performed in-depth technical editing of developer documentation, taking loosely-sketched or preliminary drafts from developers and revising for completeness, clarity, and correctness, as well as polishing the structure and style. This project includes collaboration with developers and professional services colleagues who do not normally work directly with a technical writer.

**Collaboration** - Enabled synergies between subject matter experts to improve expert-level integration documentation based on customer needs. This collaboration resulted in a fruitful conversation and an innovative new solution for a use case critical to several important customers.

## Recent Appreciation
_I would like to recognize Vivian Hood for her work on the Genesys Predictive Routing (GPR) project. Vivian is responsible for the GPR documentation._

_I've been working with Vivian for about a year as part of this project. Throughout this time, I have leaned on the GPR documentation a lot. Vivian's work has helped me learn a new product, given me material for my own deliverables, and been the source of truth for GPR. Vivian has provided extraordinary detail and an outstanding piece of content in support of our product development._

_As an example, Vivian contributed to a Customer Care training session yesterday, providing real-time answers and references to support the training, having answered most questions (through the documentation) before they were even asked._

_We are fortunate to have Vivian on our team. Thank you!_

~ Rob Marchand, Senior Director, Product Management

_Vivian and I have worked together for several years on the Predictive Routing project in Genesys where Vivian is responsible for technical documentation and I take care of quality assurance. The project has an extremely high level of complexity. It delivers an innovative AI-driven call routing solution across multiple lines: cloud, hybrid, and on-premise. Vivian is successful in quickly grasping the technical details of implementation to produce documentation that can be understood by both technical and nontechnical customers, as well as identifying gaps in explainability and requesting additional information from the development team._

~ Irina Zolotareva, QA Lead, Genesys Predictive Routing

_Thank you so much for the extraordinary job you did in orienting me to the Predictive Routing project. It would have been so easy for you to just hand the project over to me after the detailed information you provided, but I am so grateful that you decided to stay on till GA and just ease me into this complex new feature and its doc set. Thanks for taking pity on the "new girl!'_

~ Noreen Tasker, Senior Technical Writer, Genesys Cloud
